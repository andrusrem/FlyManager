# FlyManager
Test assignment project for CGI


## My progress:

### First day: 
I planed how I will do the project and looked up some API, that I can use (4-5 hours).

### On Second day:
I found Aviasales API, get key and start looking how this API work. 
Also made repository on Github and start developing Api by using Spring and Aviasales API.
