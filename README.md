# FlyManager
Test assignment project for CGI


## My progress:

### First day (4-5 hours): 
I planed how I will do the project and looked up some API, that I can use (4-5 hours).

### On Second day(maybe took 5-6 hours, maybe less I don't remember):
I found Aviasales API, get key and start looking how this API work. 
This is Api documentation link: https://support.travelpayouts.com/hc/en-us/articles/203956163-Aviasales-Data-API
Also made repository on Github and start developing Api by using Spring and Aviasales API.
#### For Http Requests decided to use HttpClient:
Here I found more info about that https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-http-client,
it was quite similar how I used it in .Net.

### On Third Day(definitely took 5 to 6 hours):
I start testing and unfortunately HTTPClient doesn't worked as planed, but I found another way
by using WEBClient
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html
#### For front I decided to use React+Vite: 
Because I already used it in the past and for this time one new framework is enough.

### On fourth day:
I had problem with request (request was forbidden) to Api, because CORS policy, but I solve it after litle research
Now I have problem on client side of the project, this is Bad Request error.
