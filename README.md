# FlyManager
Test assignment project for CGI


## My progress:

### First day: 
I planed how I will do the project and looked up some API, that I can use (4-5 hours).

### On Second day:
I found Aviasales API, get key and start looking how this API work. 
This is Api documentation link: https://support.travelpayouts.com/hc/en-us/articles/203956163-Aviasales-Data-API
Also made repository on Github and start developing Api by using Spring and Aviasales API.
#### For Http Requests decided to use HttpClient:
Here I found more info about that https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-http-client,
it was quite similar how I used it in .Net.

### On Third Day:
I start testing and unfortunately HTTPClient doesn't worked as planed, but I found another way
by using WEBClient
